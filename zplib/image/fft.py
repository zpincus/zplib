        Parameters:
            period_range: (min_size, max_size) tuple representing the minimum
                and maximum spatial size of objects in the filter's pass-band.
                Objects smaller than min_size and larger than max_size will be
                filtered out of the image. Either value can be None, indicating
                that there should be no size limit at that end of the scale.
            spacing: allows the physical spacing between array elements to be
                specified, so that the size values (above) can be given in
                physical units. This parameter can either be a scalar or a list
                of spacings in each dimension.
            order: controls the order of the butterworth filter. Higher order
                filters remove more of the structure in the stop-bands
                (specifically, those near the transition between pass-band and
                stop-band), but may introduce ringing artifacts.
            keep_dc: if True, then the DC component of the array will not be
                removed; otherwise it will. (If the DC component is removed,
                then the average array value will be zero; otherwise the
                average value will remain unchanged.)

    To filter multiple images of the same shape with the same filter parameters,
    it will be faster to construct the filter coefficients once with
    make_spatial_filter() and then apply them to each image with filter_nd().
