Curve
-----
Functions for computations over plane curves, approximated as series of points (polylines) or parametric splines.
 - curve.geometry: basic algorithms for polyline curves.
 - curve.interpolate: methods for resampling polylines and fitting them to smoothing splines (using scipy.interpolate.fitpack).
